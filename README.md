This was a project I created for an Independent Study in college.

The idea behind it was to create a Five Card Draw poker bot that plays with optimal strategy.

Rules of Five Card Draw:

Deal: Each player is dealt five cards.

Betting Round: Players take turns betting, raising, calling, or folding. If a player folds, the pot is awarded to the other player.

Draw: If no player folds, players take turns exchanging 0-5 cards in return for the same amount of cards.

Betting Round: Players again take turns betting, raising, calling, or folding. If a player folds, the pot is awarded to the other player.

Showdown: If no player folds, both players show their hands, and the winning hand is awarded the pot.


*This is still a work in progress as you can only play one hand at a time. You can still take a look at the GUI though and play a hand.*
